<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<h2>1.1 Purpose</h2>
<p>This document provides a detailed explanation of the solution as conceptualized or proposed to the requirements as laid down in solution architecture and mapping sheet.</p>

<h2>1.2 Scope</h2>
<p>The FS outlines the data flows, integration touchpoints, mapping rules, and business scenarios required to support consistent employee data replication from SAP S/4HANA to the Internal HR System.</p>

<h1>2. Integration Overview</h1>

<h2>2.1 Integration Architecture</h2>
<p>The integration architecture is designed to facilitate asynchronous employee data replication using IDoc as the source and a REST API as the target system.</p>

<h2>2.2 Integration Components</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Source System:</strong> SAP S/4HANA (IDoc)</li>
    <li><strong>Target System:</strong> Internal HR System (REST API)</li>
    <li><strong>Integration Scenario:</strong> Asynchronous Employee Data Replication</li>
    <li><strong>Security Protocol:</strong> Basic Authentication over HTTPS</li>
</ul>

<h1>3. Integration Scenarios</h1>

<h2>3.1 Scenario Description</h2>
<p>The integration scenario involves the replication of employee data from SAP S/4HANA to an internal HR system asynchronously. The data is processed and transformed as needed before being sent to the target system.</p>

<h2>3.2 Data Flow</h2>
<p>The integration flow is implemented as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>iFlow Name:</strong> Task1</li>
    <li><strong>Package Name:</strong> PDFcoveter</li>
    <li><strong>Author:</strong> Rohancherian783</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.3 Security Requirements</h2>
<p>Authorization used in the interface is listed below:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>API Domain:</strong> <code>https://accounts.eu1.</code></li>
    <li><strong>User Key and Secret:</strong> Please reach out to the CDC team for this.</li>
    <li><strong>API Key (Dev):</strong> XX</li>
</ul>

<h1>4. Error Handling and Logging</h1>
<p>Error details are handled in the exception subprocess. The integration flow includes logging for monitoring purposes. The following properties are configured:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Log Level:</strong> All events</li>
    <li><strong>Return Exception to Sender:</strong> false</li>
</ul>
<p>This section contains scripts, logs, and screenshots related to error handling and monitoring.</p>

<h1>5. Testing Validation</h1>
<p>This section contains test evidence, results, and UAT sign-off details.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Testing Details:</strong> Refer to the Testing sheet.</li>
    <li><strong>UAT Sign Off:</strong> Attached</li>
</ul>
